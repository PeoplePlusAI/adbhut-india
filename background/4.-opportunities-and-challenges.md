# 3. Diagnosis - Background, Opportunities & Challenges

Indians would be facing unintended consequences of **job** **displacements** without an AI-enabled workforce (of 500 million youth) and without a means, **models** & applications that are **not sensitive or aligned to Indian culture** and context, **models** and applications that are **not accessible** to a large majority of the country (those with less access to smartphones or ability to speak a "top-22" language, etc.), **data is in silos** which has a large **opportunity cost** in the ability to make governance, administration, distribution, logistics, etc. more efficient.



### **Background On India's Challenges & Opportunities**

* India has the largest pool of  **digital savvy young population.** In addition to this, its unique cultural makeup comprising of hundreds of languages and dialects, leads to high barriers of participation for a relatively uneducated individual.
* We have the talent - the people are h ere, and stuff is being built out of here



1. **Ecosystem Gap:** India's AI Ecosystem (companies, institutions, start-ups, government, non-profits, etc.) lacks a cohesive vision, information sharing, and policy advisory.&#x20;
2. **Talent Gap (Intellectual Infrastructure):**&#x20;
   1. **The talent problem is two-fold:**
      1. **Labour Displacement -** Lack of local AI expertise and opportunities.
      2. **Challenges of re-skilling non-displaced labour -** A large amount of jobs will still remain but their nature would change entirely with AI. Given this reality, re-skilling is vital to boost the talent's productive and competitive capabilities, particularly given other countries where talent is taught how to utilise AI capabilities.&#x20;
   2. **The opportunities**
      1. **For a large part of India, the English language has been a barrier and AI can help resolve that -** For the first time in history, language and education need no longer be barriers, as AI can remove the friction in conversing and participating.&#x20;
      2. **Skilling and training is a lot easier with the use of AI and other digital technologies** - Unlike in the past, skilling can be done in the remotest parts of the nation virtually, increasing inclusivity.&#x20;
      3. **Expanding the capabilities of women workers** - Studies have found that AI will disproportionately displace women workers globally. While this poses a challenge, this is also a great opportunity to upskill women, generate employment opportunities for them and better their living conditions.&#x20;
3. **Infrastructure Gap:**
   1. **Data Gap:** Limited representation of India's vast diversity. Not optimised for AI; ROI concerns.&#x20;
   2. **Compute Gap:** Big Models (Compute Cost) Gap: Need for sustainable, smaller models. When hundreds of millions of inferences are made. As usage of a large-scale AI model increases, the number of inferences increases, so the compute needed to handle those inferences also increases.
   3. **Models Gap:**
4. **Use-Case Gap:**&#x20;
5. **Responsible Futures:** Ethics, Policy & Jobs:&#x20;
   1. Need for AI guidelines and transparency
   2. Protection from harm, regulations
6. **Adoption & Deployment challenges**: Buy-in from Govt. and sectors belonging here?&#x20;

### **Background on AI & LLMs**

* Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks work magically at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;
* While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it. The Indian populace needs to be equipped to use it, so as to lower their barriers of participation in the workforce.

### **Paradigm Shifts (Bets we think will play out based on India & AI background)**

1. **Voice as a new platform for human-computer interaction** will emerge in India.
2. **Ability to converse at a human-level, at scale.**&#x20;
3. **AI-enabled talent** that becomes more employable, efficient, and capable than ever before.
4. **Emergence of a robust and enabling AI regulation regime**.&#x20;
5. **Grassroot level penetration of AI technology**, including its adoption by lower tiers of governments and individual citizens.&#x20;
6. **Efficiency in decision making and governance**, owing to AI adoption by domestic stakeholders.&#x20;

These paradigm shifts are hypotheses. They will be constantly iterated upon, improved, and changed based on what is happening on the ground.

### **Conclusion**

Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution, but for virtually every sector.

This change is powerful and needs to be orchestrated with a concerted effort across government, businesses, educational and research institutions. For this we need a comprehensive strategy.

3. Challenge of competing with Large Models and cost of compute.
