# 3. Diagnosis - Background, Opportunities & Challenges

## **Background On India's Challenges & Opportunities**

* Indians would be facing unintended consequences of **job** **displacements** without an AI-enabled workforce (of 500 million youth) and without a means, **models** & applications that are **not sensitive or aligned to Indian culture** and context, **models** and applications that are **not accessible** to a large majority of the country (those with less access to smartphones or ability to speak a "top-22" language, etc.), **data is in silos** which has a large **opportunity cost** in the ability to make governance, administration, distribution, logistics, etc. more efficient.
* India, the cradle of a young, digitally astute populace, sits on the cusp of an AI-driven metamorphosis. However, the promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not without challenges. A juxtaposition of diverse cultures and languages adds layers of complexity, while job displacement looms large. Our task is to align the AI ecosystem with India's unique socio-economic tapestry, ensuring inclusivity and adaptability.
* **Leveraging a Youthful Demography:** With a 500 million-strong youthful workforce, India has the human capital crucial for an AI-enabled future. Yet, without an AI narrative that's attuned to our cultural and linguistic diversity, we risk alienating a significant portion of our populace. The goal is to create AI models and applications that resonate with India’s ethos, ensuring accessibility even for those on the fringes of digital literacy.



## Gaps in the India AI Ecosystem

### **Use-Case Gaps**

* Identifying practical and impactful use-cases tailored to the Indian socio-economic milieu remains pivotal.&#x20;
* Creating AI models that understand and are aligned with Indian cultural nuances and languages will catalyse adoption across sectors.



### **Infrastructure Gaps**

1. **Data Gap:** Limited representation of India's vast diversity. Not optimised for AI.&#x20;
   1. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.
   2. India has a comparative advantage with the Digital Public Infrastructure based frameworks tending to have a very high adoption and they make sense for the complexity and cross-collaboration of companies to increase efficiency.&#x20;
2. **Compute Gap**. Big Models (Compute Cost) Gap: Need for sustainable, smaller models. When hundreds of millions of inferences are made: as usage of a large-scale AI model increases, the number of inferences increases, so the compute needed to handle those inferences also increases.
3. **Models Gap.** There's a pressing need for models that can efficiently operate within the Indian context, understanding myriad languages, dialects, and regional nuances, bridging the digital divide.



### **Talent Gaps**&#x20;

1. **Loss of Jobs in some sectors and re-skilling displaced workers.** Job Lack of local AI expertise and opportunities.
2. **Up-skilling for non-displaced labour**. A large amount of jobs will still remain but their nature would change entirely with AI. A re-skilling is required here for the talent to be more productive to compete especially with other countries where talent is using AI
3. **For a large part of India, the English language has been a barrier in formal,** and for the first time in history, language and education need no longer be barriers as AI can remove the friction to talk to participate.&#x20;

* **Based on Type of Workers**
  * **On Agriculture & Allied Workers (200 million+)** - The largest challenge for India to reduce its workforce dependency on agriculture has been a lack of education and training towards industry for these workers. What AI will enable us to do is to exponentially increase access to industry for this workforce by letting them participate in the formal economy and industrial economy by just speaking to an interface in their native dialect and language and learn too from it. It might seem ambitious to cause a migration of work from Agriculture to other sectors but the example of the US shows it can be done. **Agriculture was 50% of us employment in 1900, and by 1970 it was 4% in the US.**&#x20;
  * **Blue Collar Workers & Gig-Workers.** The major hurdles faced by this segment include lack of modernised training programs, limited access to advanced technological tools, and often, a language barrier owing to India's linguistic diversity.
  * **On builders / researchers / engineers** - There is a need to attract & retain talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.



### **Ecosystem Gaps**

* **India's AI Ecosystem** (companies, institutions, start-ups, government, non-profits, etc.) lacks a cohesive vision, information sharing, and policy advisory. This strategy is aimed to tackle this.
* **India also lacks an AI policy or regulatory framework** or a feedback loop with the policy makers that is inclusive of the entire AI ecosystem and extended community. Emergence of a robust and enabling AI regulation regime would help the ecosystem growth accelarate.
* **The ecosystem also lacks an alignment in ensuring a Responsible Future and specific alignment on** Ethics, values & policies which have practical implications on copyright law with AI generated content, guidelines and transparency for AI generated content, etc.&#x20;
* **Adoption & Deployment challenges**: The ecosystem faces challenges in deployment of robust AI systems for consumers.

## **Background on AI & LLMs**

* Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks work magically at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;
* While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it. The Indian populace needs to be equipped to use it, so as to lower their barriers of participation in the workforce.

## **Important Paradigm Shifts (Bets we think will play out based on India & AI background)**

These paradigm shifts are hypotheses. They will be constantly iterated upon, improved, and changed based on what is happening on the ground.

1. **Voice as a new platform for human-computer interaction** will emerge in India.
2. **Ability to converse at a human-level, at scale.** This would increase efficiency in decision making and governance, owing to AI adoption by domestic stakeholders.&#x20;
3. **AI-enabled talent** that becomes more employable, efficient, and capable than ever before.

&#x20;

## **Conclusion**

Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution, but for virtually every sector.

This change is powerful and needs to be orchestrated with a concerted effort across government, businesses, educational and research institutions. For this we need a comprehensive strategy.
