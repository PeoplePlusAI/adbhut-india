# 3. Diagnosis - Background, Opportunities & Challenges

Indians would be facing unintended consequences of **job** **displacements** without an AI-enabled workforce (of 500 million youth) and without a means t, **models** & applications that are **not sensitive or aligned to Indian culture** and context, **models** and applications that are **not accessible** to a large majority of the country (those with less access to smartphones or ability to speak a "top-22" language, etc.), **data is in silos** which has a large **opportunity cost** in the ability to make governance, administration, distribution, logistics, etc. more efficient.



### **Background On India's Challenges & Opportunities**

* India has the largest **digital savvy young population.** It also has a unique environment of hundreds of dialects and languages which have led to high barriers of participation for a relatively uneducated individual.
* We have the talent - the people are here, and stuff is being built out of here



1. **Ecosystem Gap:** India's AI Ecosystem (companies, institutions, startups, government, non-profits, etc.) lacks a cohesive vision & information sharing & policy advisory.&#x20;
2. **Talent Gap (Intellectual Infrastructure):**&#x20;
   1. **The talent problem is two-fold.**
      1. **Labour Displacement.** Job Lack of local AI expertise and opportunities.
      2. **Challenges of re-skilling for non-displaced labour**. A large amount of jobs will still remain but their nature would change entirely with AI. A re-skilling is required here for the talent to be more productive to compete especially with other countries where talent is using AI
   2. **The opportunities**
      1. **For a large part of India, the English language has been a barrier in formal,** and for the first time in history, language and education need no longer be barriers as AI can remove the friction to talk to participate.&#x20;
3. **Infrastructure Gap:**
   1. **Data Gap:** Limited representation of India's vast diversity. Not optimised for AI; ROI concerns.&#x20;
   2. **Compute Gap**. Big Models (Compute Cost) Gap: Need for sustainable, smaller models. When hundreds of millions of inferences are made: as usage of a large-scale AI model increases, the number of inferences increases, so the compute needed to handle those inferences also increases.
   3. **Models Gap.**
4. **Use-Case Gap:**&#x20;
5. **Responsible Futures:** Ethics, Policy & Jobs:&#x20;
   1. Need for AI guidelines and transparency
   2. Protection from harm, regulations
6. **Adoption & Deployment challenges**: Buy-in from Govt. and sectors belonging here?&#x20;





### **Background on AI & LLMs**

* Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks work magically at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;
* While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it. And enable the populace to use it to lower their barriers of participation in the workforce.



### **Paradigm Shifts (Bets we think will play out based on India & AI background)**

1. **Voice as a new platform for human-computer interaction** will emerge in India.
2. **Ability to converse at a human-level at scale.**&#x20;
3. **AI-enabled talent** that becomes more employable, capable and efficient than ever before.

These paradigm shifts are hypotheses. They will be constantly iterated upon and improved and changed based on what's happening on the ground.



### **Conclusion**

Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution do, but for virtually every sector.

This change is powerful and needs to be orchestrated with a concerted effort across Government, companies and educational and research institutions. For this we need a comprehensive strategy.
