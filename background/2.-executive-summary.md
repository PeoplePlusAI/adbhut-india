# 1. Executive Summary

### **Why do we need a strategy?**

Al is poised to become the backbone of global productivity. For India to evolve into a developed nation by 2047, capitalising on Al isn't optional â€”it's imperative. We can't afford to let Al's course in India be determined [by inertia](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. **We must architect our future deliberately.**



### **Background & Challenges**

Without an AI enabled workforce (500 million), Indians will face the unintended consequences of **job displacements**. The lack of a proactive approach towards AI adoption and development, would mean AI models & applications will not be **sensitive or aligned to Indian culture** and will remain **inaccessible** to a large majority of the country.

The lack of means to evaluate and use data means, **it remains in silos,** leading to large **opportunity costs** in efficient and effective decision making (governance, administration, distribution, logistics, etc.). Furthermore, a lethargic approach to AI adoption can **hasten cultural erosion** across Indian languages (more than 500 languages), especially to rich regional dialects. Another major challenge faced by developing nations like India, is the **high compute cost**, making it difficult for Indian startups and companies, to participate in the AI revolution, possibly leaving us behind in the race.



**Opportunities**

Our opportunity is having a young & digitally savvy population that's ready to be AI-enabled. AI can improve employability for them if they are trained well. We have a potential talent pool. the people are here, and stuff is being built out of here. We need to nurture and promote it further.

The complexity of life in India leads to challenges but also many use cases. Eg: Multiple languages and dialects, mixed coding, etc. Each challenge being tackled well lets India catapult to the frontier with AI.



### **Guiding Policy (Our Approach)**

In order to tackle these challenges, we need a set of guiding principles that lets us frame a strategy.&#x20;

1. **Have a use-case led, people-first approach**
   1. Picking winning use cases for India's problem can lead to companies building for India, and attracting foreign capital to India.
   2. &#x20;This would help us focus our efforts and attention. It is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, but our path to prove that India can do it meaninfully, and well.
2. **Emphasis the Ecosystem (Create ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way)**
   1. Preservation of culture
   2. For LLMs to be useful to the population, we need to understand them. It is part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI.
3. **Ensure Trust & an Inclusive, Responsible Future**
   1. Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. **We need to focus limited resources - not end up in a war over them**
   2. The DPI approach, moved the layer of competition from siloed gardens to broad reach





### **Key Actions**

1. **Create a vibrant ecosystem with information sharing.** This might not seem important, but the physical and virtual spaces to collaborate and share learnings have always lead to great strides in innovation. Be it Silicon Valley or Bangalore.
2. **+ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture**
   1. Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this
   2. Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs
3. **Data was always valuable but will soon become a closely guarded - so we should double down on AA-like frameworks**
   1. Indians having control over their data and being able ot share it freely can create more opportunities and innovation than we thought possible
4. **Compute**
   1. compute is a positive IRR business - government should not be procuring but incentivising to make available
   2. Compute bonds or pre-purchased credits can help - VCs put capital into pre-purchased GPUs and pooling vehicles - this can then be distributed by VCs to startups. Who then can redeem against any provider - let the market carry the risk of techonology obsolescence, and distribute rewards to those in need.



**Pratyush comments:**&#x20;

1. I like the (maybe too) simplified two track discussion of 'diverse use' and 'plus ai talent'
2. **For diverse use**, in my mind I have the analogy of a road network. Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village kachcha roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems.&#x20;
3. **For 'plus ai' talent**, we need to talk about both job displacement and tremendous opportunity in enhancing productivity. Making this transition towards an AI future, likely with the help of AI is a critical step. Given demographic dividend, and a country hungry for opportunity/knowledge, this can be a way India leads.
4. **What would it take to do the above?** I would call out three broad things - (a) an available and inexpensive compute infrastructure, (b) builders and researchers unlocked to innovate, (c) a conducive and fair legal framework.
   1. **On compute** - Establish need for training and inferencing. Espeically the need for specific accelerators which are in short supply. For now we buy, but we need a long term strategy to make compute available with limited dependence. AI is the future of computing, and its needs a lot of compute. Can we think of 1 TFLOP per citizen?
   2. **On builders / researchers** - Need to attract talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.
   3. **Legal framework** - Should provide clarity for innovators, should lean towards creating value at scale for citizens while being heavy against misinformation or other hazards. Should incentivise local innovation with support for models trained in India in population scale use-cases&#x20;

    General feedback :

    1. Say positive things, use negative sparingly
    2. NEVER bash down anyone - no matter how seemingly popular the view. (e.g. big tech)
    3. There are incentive structures that drive everyone, we are not here to judge them, but configure them in a way that benefits india.
