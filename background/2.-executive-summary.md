# 1. Executive Summary

### **Why do we need a strategy?**

The impact of AI will be bigger, wider, & faster than any other technology ever before. With the right set of data, enough compute and a carefully selected model - most tasks that seemed like only a human could do the computers are able to do.&#x20;

For India to evolve into a developed nation by 2047, capitalising on Al isn't optional â€”it's imperative. And shaping our AI future by design (instead of having it be shaped by default) gives us the opportunity to steer the direction of AI's impact, ensuring that the benefits of AI are widespread and responsibly reach every stratum of society.



### **Challenges & Opportunities**

* **People**. India already has a young & digitally savvy workforce and population that's ready to be AI-enabled. We need to nurture and promote it further. AI can improve employability for them if they are trained well. Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this. Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs
* **Data, Models & Compute.** have an opportunity to create datasets capturing India's varied languages and dialects that increase access and reduce bias. Align models to Indian culture and context, make compute (processing power) for training accessible to the larger ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Use-case focused Applications.** The complexity of life in India leads to challenges but also many use cases. Eg: Multiple languages and dialects, mixed coding, etc. Each challenge being tackled well lets India catapult to the frontier with AI.
* **Ecosystem-centric Approach.** We believe the best way to tackle this for India is through an ecosystem-centric approach.&#x20;



### **Guiding Policy (Our Approach)**

In order to tackle these challenges, we need a set of guiding principles that lets us frame a strategy.&#x20;

1. **Be use-case lead.** This would help us focus our efforts and attention. It is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, but our path to prove that India can do it meaningfully, and well.
2. **Foster collaborations.** India's success with Digital Public Infrastructure such as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has shown that such of creating ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way works remarkably well.&#x20;
3. **Think in First Principles of Second-Order Effects.** Think through before you release.
4. **Do it Responsibly.** Ensure alignment to not for safety but to the culture for accessible & varied use.





### **Key Actions**

1. **Create a vibrant ecosystem promoting information sharing.** This might not seem important, but the physical and virtual spaces to collaborate and share learnings have always lead to great strides in innovation. Be it Silicon Valley or Bangalore.
2. **+ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture.** Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs
3. **Data was always valuable but will soon become a closely guarded -** so we should double down on AA-like **data-sharing frameworks**. Indians having control over their data and being able to share it freely can create more opportunities and innovation than we thought possible
4. **Compute.** Compute bonds or pre-purchased credits can help - investors put capital into pre-purchased GPUs and pooling vehicles - this can then be distributed by investors to startups. Who then can redeem against any provider - let the market carry the risk of techonology obsolescence, and distribute rewards to those in need.
5. **Model.** Propagate evaluation, creation and deployment of sustainable AI models that align to Indian culture, context, & languages.



**Pratyush comments:**&#x20;

1. I like the (maybe too) simplified two track discussion of 'diverse use' and 'plus ai talent'
2. **For diverse use**, in my mind I have the analogy of a road network. Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village kachcha roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems.&#x20;
3. **For 'plus ai' talent**, we need to talk about both job displacement and tremendous opportunity in enhancing productivity. Making this transition towards an AI future, likely with the help of AI is a critical step. Given demographic dividend, and a country hungry for opportunity/knowledge, this can be a way India leads.
4. **What would it take to do the above?** I would call out three broad things - (a) an available and inexpensive compute infrastructure, (b) builders and researchers unlocked to innovate, (c) a conducive and fair legal framework.
   1. **On compute** - Establish need for training and inferencing. Espeically the need for specific accelerators which are in short supply. For now we buy, but we need a long term strategy to make compute available with limited dependence. AI is the future of computing, and its needs a lot of compute. Can we think of 1 TFLOP per citizen?
   2. **On builders / researchers** - Need to attract talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.
   3. **Legal framework** - Should provide clarity for innovators, should lean towards creating value at scale for citizens while being heavy against misinformation or other hazards. Should incentivise local innovation with support for models trained in India in population scale use-cases&#x20;
