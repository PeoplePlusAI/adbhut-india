# 2. Introduction

### **The AI Revolution**

AI is already well in use today, from biometrics that unlock your phone, to website recommendations. Models so far allowed for predictions to be made on "structured data". Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data. The progress from here is going to be rapid and change a lot of things. The new class of AI models are able to understand and make sense of human language.&#x20;

**With these models, in the coming few years, AI will impact more than a billion Indians and the Indian economy.** There are these tasks in every job where they become more and more automated (to surprising effect). The impact of AI will be bigger, wider, & faster than any other technology ever before.&#x20;





### **India's AI Advantage & Towards a Future by Design**

Most of this recent pioneering research around AI has come out of large companies and research institutions in the USA. India on top of its commitment to research, has the unique opportunity to become a leading production and use-case pioneer.

A key example is the expansion of digital payment systems. Although not invented in India, the technology has garnered the largest user base here with UPI. This is because it was built uniquely to suit India's needs as an open network. This had many trickle down effects including increasing digital penetration, financial inclusion, expanding financial and digital literacy, etc.&#x20;



**We want India to be at the forefront of AI in Use, and we want it to work for the people.** AI can be part of the missing link that fills the productivity gaps of our economy; helping unlock new kinds of efficiencies and ensure equitable growth. But this won't happen by accident. Without models that are aligned to Indian culture and without say data of less-popular Indian languages readily available, AI will remain in-accessible to a large part of the population that don't speak a popular language. **Left to chance, AI will likely lead to deep unemployment and even exacerbate inequality.**



**To avoid this we need to move to a future by design**. **We need a clear, deliberate, inclusive and comprehensive strategy**. If done right, AI can be a lever that helps India take its next leap with a new kind of operational efficiency and productivity gains that will not be possible without it. This strategy gives us the confidence that the next five to 10 years with AI are going to define the future of India. A future where children are better educated, where people are healthier, where they can use technology in any of India’s 120+ languages, and where everybody can get every imaginable service they want. A future where nobody is left behind.



### Success Targets for the Strategy

1. **By 2030, India should have become a fully “plus-AI” talent capital for the world** (just like it has been a services capital for the world) with a more than 500 million AI-ready workforce, leveraging our demographic dividend (not letting it become a demographic burden because of AI-based job displacement).&#x20;
2. **By 2030, every Indian should have access to world-class services (specially ones that that require expertise) and is bottle-necked to access services.** We have meaningful access to services and products, especially that in areas which are bottle-necked (such as health, education, justice, etc.)
3. **By 2030, India should be able to secure infrastructure for its own citizens such that there is an ample amount of compute power and other resources.** As an example this could also be quantified as something like 1 PetaFlop per citizen.&#x20;
4. **India by 2030 should have in place a comprehensive data sharing framework** for AI Training that allows for privacy guarantees according to Indian laws. This would enable private innovation on top of. Eg: We should aim to have 1 trillion tokens available across all languages available from Govt. And a data sharing framework to get access to the data in a private & secure manner.
5. **By 2030 (or before), India should have clearly defined the use of AI in a just, secure, & fair manner.** We have a framework of responsibilities on companies & protections on harms from the same.



**This strategy will always be a Work in Progress, by design.** AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines.&#x20;

**Note**: By India here we mean the Government, the companies, people, other research institutions, among other stakeholders that use AI to have an impact or get impacted by AI.

1. <mark style="color:purple;">**What will be the quantified economical impact on India with AI? In Jobs (Unemployment and migration) and GDP Growth.**</mark>&#x20;
2. <mark style="color:purple;">**What KPIs will be used to evaluate the success of the AI strategy? We should define some quantifiable metrics to track progress.**</mark>&#x20;
