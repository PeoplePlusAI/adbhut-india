# READ ME: Adbhut India (AI)

## Executive Summary

**Adbhut India (or 'Amazing' India)** is conceptual destination where India fully harnesses the transformative power of AI, to improve the lives of all Indians. ‘Adbhut’ means ‘amazing’ or ‘incredible’ in Hindi. **In this vision, AI is equitably accessible and instrumental in solving India’s challenges related to access, productivity, and expertise bottlenecks.** And Indians are able to adopt it at a population-scale.&#x20;

**Reaching this destination is not inevitable.** But India for AI and AI for India will help us reach there. There are still ecosystem-level challenges to tackle before we can get to such a destination.



**The Adbhut India (AI) Project is a collective and a strategy.** It describes a strategy for reaching the destination of an 'Adbhut' or 'wonderful' India with the use of AI. It is a future where the collective efforts of the ecosystem overcome prevailing obstacles, leveraging AI’s capabilities to the fullest and, in turn, allowing AI to benefit from India's unique landscape.&#x20;



**In order to reach that destination**, we need to solve ecosystem-level challenges that India faces that. These challenges include data gaps, cost of compute, talent re-skilling, etc.&#x20;

To solve these, we aim to create a collective of the key stakeholders in the AI ecosystem (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens).&#x20;



**Note**: Currently this is a private Github repository that houses instructions to update the Adbhut AI strategy document as well as update the project plan. It will be made public soon.
