# READ ME: Adbhut India (AI) Strategy

**The Adbhut India (AI)** Project is focused on creating a manifesto that talks about the strategic role that India (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens) can play to its advantages in AI and help create a leading, robust AI ecosystem.&#x20;

Given India's vast and diverse population, along with its multitude of potential applications, it is crucial to implement a prudent strategy that harnesses AI to unlock the "path to potential" for national progress and social good and be a use-case capital of the world in AI.&#x20;

The strategy is named after its end-goal, of creating an Adbhut (or a wonderful) India.



**Note**: Currently this is a private Github repository that houses instructions to update the Adbhut AI strategy document as well as update the project plan. It will be made public soon.
