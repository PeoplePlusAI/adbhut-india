# READ ME: Adbhut AI Strategy

This is a private github repository that houses instructions to update the Adbhut AI strategy document as well as update the project plan

##

The Adbhut AI project is focused on creating a strategy manifesto that talks about the strategic role that India (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens) can play to its advantages in AI and help create a leading, robust AI ecosystem. Given India's vast and diverse population, along with its multitude of potential applications, it is crucial to implement a prudent strategy that harnesses AI to unlock the "path to potential" for national progress and social good and be a use-case capital of the world in AI. The strategy document is being housed on Gitbook and can be accessed here: https://app.gitbook.com/invite/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/MV1tnadnJzwSAMJllfkW&#x20;

## Instructions to manage the project plan:

* [ ] There is one project titled "Adbhut India (AI's Path to Potential)" under this repository that captures our roadmap and task list to get to the launch of this manifesto at the Campsite in November 2023.
* [ ] There are two types of tasks listed in the project: tasks and milestones associated with writing, reviewing and iterating the content draft; as well as process-related tasks to manage collaboration internally and externally.
* [ ] All contributors have "WRITE" access to the project plan. We are utilizing this project plan to ensure we are directionally closing tasks. Owners writing different sections will be responsible for coordination and closing of the sub-tasks related to their section.
* [ ] There are different views/ slicers to review the project plan. Please feel free to create new views.
