# READ ME: Adbhut India (AI)

**The Adbhut India (AI)** Project outlines a strategy for reaching a destination of an 'Adbhut' or 'wonderful' India with the use of AI. In order to reach that destination, it aims to create a collective of the key stakeholders in the AI ecosystem (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens) in order to solve ecosystem-level challenges that India faces that prevent it from realising the vision of an Adbhut India.



**Note**: Currently this is a private Github repository that houses instructions to update the Adbhut AI strategy document as well as update the project plan. It will be made public soon.
