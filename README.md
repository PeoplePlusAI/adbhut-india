# READ ME: Adbhut India (AI)

## Executive Summary

**Adbhut India (or 'Amazing' India)** is conceptual destination where India fully harnesses the transformative power of AI, to improve the lives of all Indians. ‘Adbhut’ means ‘amazing’ or ‘incredible’ in Hindi. **In this vision, AI is equitably accessible and instrumental in solving India’s challenges related to access, productivity, and expertise bottlenecks.** And Indians are using it to better their lives.

Many people would agree to such a vision for the country. But getting there is hard. The path is not obvious and there are very big challenges. But India for AI and AI for India will greatly help us reach there. We firmly believe that AI won't change the world; you will.



**People+ai is working with various partners organisations and volunteers to achieve an Adbhut India.** In order to get there, we are working on these main challenges:

1. **Use-case gaps.** Discovering and demonstrating meaningful use-cases that will matter most to India.
2. **Infrastructure** **gaps** (around lack of availability of the right data, the cost of compute, and missed evaluation of models that work well for Indian context )&#x20;
3. **Talent** **gaps** (including dealing with job-displacements via re-skilling and the deep research & engineering talent for AI in India)
4. **Ecosystem-specific** **gaps** (including policy & community building).

Read more about them [here](adbhut-india/3.-ecosystem-gaps-and-how-to-tackle-them.md).







**To solve these, we aim to create a collective of the key stakeholders in the AI ecosystem (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens).** Because ecosystem-level challenges require ecosystem-level solutions.

Read more about the principles to collaborate on [here](adbhut-india/3.-ecosystem-gaps-and-how-to-tackle-them.md#3.2.-we-need-a-collective-to-create-ecosystem-level-solutions.) & the [key actions planned to tackle the challenges here](adbhut-india/4.-key-actions-planned.md).
