# READ ME: Adbhut India (AI)

## Executive Summary

**Adbhut India (or 'Amazing' India)** is conceptual destination where India fully harnesses the transformative power of AI, to improve the lives of all Indians. ‘Adbhut’ means ‘amazing’ or ‘incredible’ in Hindi. **In this vision, AI is equitably accessible and instrumental in solving India’s challenges related to access, productivity, and expertise bottlenecks.** And Indians are able to adopt it at a population-scale.&#x20;

**Reaching this destination is not inevitable.** But India for AI and AI for India will help us reach there. There are still ecosystem-level challenges to tackle before we can get to such a destination.



**The Adbhut India (AI) Project is a collective and a strategy devised to solve the ecosystem-level challenges that prevent us from getting to an Adbhut India.** These challenges include:

1. **Infrastructure** **gaps** (around lack of availability of the right data, the cost of compute, and missed evaluation of models that work well for Indian context )&#x20;
2. **Talent** **gaps** (including dealing with job-displacements via re-skilling and the deep research & engineering talent for AI in India)
3. **Ecosystem-specific** **gaps** (including policy & community building).

Read more about them [here](adbhut-india/3.-ecosystem-challenges-and-how-to-tackle-them.md).



**To solve these, we aim to create a collective of the key stakeholders in the AI ecosystem (Government, companies, researchers, educational institutions & citizens).** Because ecosystem-level challenges require ecosystem-level solutions.
