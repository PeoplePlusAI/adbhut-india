# 1. Executive Summary

### **Why do we need a strategy?**

The impact of AI will be bigger, wider, & faster than any other technology ever before. With the right set of data, enough compute and a carefully selected model - most tasks that seemed like only a human could do the computers are able to do.&#x20;

For India to evolve into a developed nation by 2047, capitalising on Al isn't optional â€”it's imperative. And shaping our AI future by design (instead of having it be shaped by default) gives us the opportunity to steer the direction of AI's impact, ensuring that the benefits of AI are widespread and responsibly reach every stratum of India.



### **Challenges & Opportunities**

* **Use-case Led Applications.** The complexity of life in India leads to challenges but also many use cases. Eg: Multiple languages and dialects, mixed coding, etc. Each challenge being tackled well lets India catapult to the frontier with AI.
* **Infrastructure (Data, Models & Compute).** We have an opportunity to create datasets capturing India's varied languages and dialects that increase access and reduce bias. We also need to align models to Indian culture and context, make compute (processing power) for training accessible to the larger ecosystem.&#x20;
* **People**. India already has a young & digitally savvy workforce and population that's ready to be AI-enabled. We need to nurture and promote it further. AI can improve employability for them if they are trained well. Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this. Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs.
* **Ecosystem-centric Approach.** We believe the best way to tackle this for India is through an ecosystem-centric approach.&#x20;



### **Guiding Policy (Our Approach)**

In order to tackle these challenges, we need a set of guiding principles that lets us frame a strategy.&#x20;

1. **Be use-case lead.** This would help us focus our efforts and attention. It is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, but our path to prove that India can do it meaningfully, and well.
2. **Foster collaborations.** India's success with Digital Public Infrastructure such as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has shown that such of creating ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way works remarkably well.&#x20;
3. **Think in First Principles of Second-Order Effects.** Think through before you release.
4. **Do it Responsibly.** Ensure alignment to not for safety but to the culture for accessible & varied use.



### **Key Actions**

1. **Identification & propagation of use-cases.** In order to be truly use-case led, we need to do research for the identification of use-cases as well as pilot hero use-cases and observe their transformation with in-field deployment and research.
2. **Creation of data-sharing frameworks and strategy to unlock data.** Data was always valuable but will soon become a closely guarded - so we should double down on Digital Public Infrastructure-based data-sharing frameworks. Indians having control over their data and being able to share it freely can create more opportunities and innovation than we thought possible
3. **Enabling access to affordable Compute.** Compute bonds or pre-purchased credits can help - investors put capital into pre-purchased GPUs and pooling vehicles - this can then be distributed by investors to startups, who then can redeem against any provider. Let the market carry the risk of technology obsolescence, and distribute rewards to those in need.
4. **Model Innovation & Evaluation Against India.** We need to accelerate evaluation, creation and deployment of sustainable AI models that align to Indian culture, context, & languages.
5. **+ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture.** Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs
6. **Create a vibrant ecosystem promoting information sharing.** This might not seem important, but the physical and virtual spaces to collaborate and share learnings have always lead to great strides in innovation. Be it Silicon Valley or Bangalore. This strategy itself is a step forward in achieving this.
