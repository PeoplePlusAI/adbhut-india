# 3. Background (Optional)

\


Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution do, but for virtually every sector.

\


The Transformer Model and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks do work at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;

\


While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it.

Open Questions :&#x20;

1. How do we frame a narrative around “how we got here” or what has happened so far. A bird’s eye view of Prof. Mitesh’s article can be useful here, incredibly concise without many technical details.
