# 2. Executive Summary

**Owner: Tanuj, Tanvi**

(We should definitely have this section either first or second)

1\. **Background** arguments to be made - this can be in guiding policy/background : ''

a. The complexity of life in india leads to many use cases

* multi language
* mixed coding
* Opportunity: young population
* digitally savvy

b. WE have the talent - the people are here, and stuff is being built out of here

* Get data from elsewhere&#x20;
* The I in AI is india article



**Guiding Policy**

1. Use-case led approach can make us focus our efforts and attention
   1. Picking winning use cases for India's problem can lead to companies building for India, and attracting foreign capital to india.
   2. This is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, this is our path to prove that India can do it.

* Digital payments although not invented here, have the largest use here because of the lack of systems that work

2. Preservation of culture

* For LLMs to be useful to the population we want - we need to understand them
* Need examples of how chat gpt messes up for india
* Indian tokens are expensive
* Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI

3. We need to focus limited resources - not end up in a war over them

* The DPI approach, moved the layer of competition from siloed gardens to broad reach
* The novelty



**Actions**

**h. Data was always valuable but will soon become a closely guarded - so we should double down on AA-like frameworks**

* Indians having control over their data and being able ot share it freely can create more opportunities and innovation than we thought possible

**i. +ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture**

* Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this
* Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs

**j. Compute - there should also be compute bonds**

* compute is a positive IRR business - government should not be procuring but incentivising to make available
* Compute bonds or prepurchased credits can help - VCs put capital into prepurchased GPUs and pooling vehicles - this can then be distributed by VCs to startups. Who then can redeem against any provider - let the market carry the risk of techonology obsolescence, and distribute rewards to those in need
* How to give compute to academia? How to give compute to government use cases?
* How to have Government / Private partnerships work with data

**k. How to price Data ?**

* Can we create mechanisms of dataset discovery and&#x20;



**Pratyush comments:**&#x20;

1. I like the (maybe too) simplified two track discussion of 'diverse use' and 'plus ai talent'
2. **For diverse use**, in my mind I have the analogy of a road network. Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village kachcha roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems.&#x20;
3. **For 'plus ai' talent**, we need to talk about both job displacement and tremendous opportunity in enhancing productivity. Making this transition towards an AI future, likely with the help of AI is a critical step. Given demographic dividend, and a country hungry for opportunity/knowledge, this can be a way India leads.
4. **What would it take to do the above?** I would call out three broad things - (a) an available and inexpensive compute infrastructure, (b) builders and researchers unlocked to innovate, (c) a conducive and fair legal framework.
   1. **On compute** - Establish need for training and inferencing. Espeically the need for specific accelerators which are in short supply. For now we buy, but we need a long term strategy to make compute available with limited dependence. AI is the future of computing, and its needs a lot of compute. Can we think of 1 TFLOP per citizen?
   2. **On builders / researchers** - Need to attract talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.
   3. **Legal framework** - Should provide clarity for innovators, should lean towards creating value at scale for citizens while being heavy against misinformation or other hazards. Should incentivise local innovation with support for models trained in India in population scale use-cases&#x20;
