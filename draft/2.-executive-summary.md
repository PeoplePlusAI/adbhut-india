1\. Background arguments to be made - this can be in guiding policy/background : ''

a. The complexity of life in india leads to many use cases

* multi language
* mixed coding
* Opportunity: young population
* digitally savvy

b. WE have the talent - the people are here, and stuff is being built out of here

* Get data from elsewhere&#x20;
* The I in AI is india article

c. Use-case led approach can make us focus our efforts and attention

d. Picking winning use cases for India's problem can lead to companies building for India, and attracting foreign capital to india.

e. This is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, this is our path to prove that India can do it.

* Digital payments although not invented here, have the largest use here because of the lack of systems that work

f. Preservation of culture

* For LLMs to be useful to the population we want - we need to understand them
* Need examples of how chat gpt messes up for india
* Indian tokens are expensive
* Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI

g. We need to focus limited resources - not end up in a war over them

* The DPI approach, moved the layer of competition from siloed gardens to broad reach
* The novelty

h. Data was always valuable but will soon become a closely guarded - so we should double down on AA-like frameworks

* Indians having control over their data and being able ot share it freely can create more opportunities and innovation than we thought possible

i. +ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture

* Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this
* Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs

j. Compute - there should also be compute bonds

* compute is a positive IRR business - government should not be procuring but incentivising to make available
* Compute bonds or prepurchased credits can help - VCs put capital into prepurchased GPUs and pooling vehicles - this can then be distributed by VCs to startups. Who then can redeem against any provider - let the market carry the risk of techonology obsolescence, and distribute rewards to those in need
* How to give compute to academia? How to give compute to government use cases?
* How to have Government / Private partnerships work with data

k. How to price Data ?

* Can we create mechanisms of dataset discovery and&#x20;
