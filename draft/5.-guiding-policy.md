# 5. Guiding Policy (Our Approach)

**Owner**: Tanuj & Harsha



* **Guiding Policy 1:** **Solve real & diverse problems of Bharat of today** especially that are unique to India.
  * India should be building models that are specialised and solve real problems.&#x20;
  * Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village kachcha roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems.&#x20;
  * **Corollary: We need to have in our action plan a feedback loop of generating insights** on Indian problems solvable with AI and share them openly.
  * **AI for us should not become a hammer looking for a nail.** Another corollary is that we need to focus on the problems and use-cases to solve, and then evaluate if AI makes sense there.&#x20;
* **Guiding Policy 2 - Emphasise the Ecosystem (Jugalbandi):**&#x20;
  * We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation and grow the ecosystem at large, resisting a default power law
    * **. We have to bring together** the public, private enterprises and research institutions to build systems out of jugal-bandi.&#x20;
* **Guiding Policy 3 - Create open ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way.**
  * India's approach of creating Digital Public Infrastructure with a public railroad with private innovation has unlocked enormous productivity. With AI, there is an additional emphasis on the educational institutions&#x20;
  * This even has implications on re-thinking privacy. We do nothing at the cost of privacy (which is a fundamental right for Indians). Privacy is going to be rethought in the age of ai. You want something to be personalised, but you don't want adverse effects. So what does that mean? Can a model use your data or not?



* **Guiding Preservation of culture**
  * For LLMs to be useful to the population we want - we need to understand them
  * Need examples of how chat gpt messes up for india
  * Indian tokens are expensive
  * Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI\

1. Can talk in terms of an easy-to-understand framework like the golden triangle of AI
