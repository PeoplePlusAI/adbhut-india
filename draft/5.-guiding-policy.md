# 5. Guiding Policy

Owner: Tanuj & Harsha



* **Guiding Policy 1:** **Solve real Indian problems** especially that are unique to India. As a matter of strategy, India and the ecosystem should be building models that are specialised and solve real problems.
* **Guiding Policy 2:** We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation and grow the ecosystem at large, resisting a default power law
* **Guiding Policy 3:** We do nothing at the cost of privacy (which is a fundamental right for Indians)
  * Privacy is going to be rethought in the age of ai. You want something to be personalised, but you don't want adverse effects. So what does that mean? Can a model use your data or not?



*   **Guiding Preservation of culture**

    * For LLMs to be useful to the population we want - we need to understand them
    * Need examples of how chat gpt messes up for india
    * Indian tokens are expensive
    * Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI
