* Guiding Policy 1: Solve real problems especially that are unique to India. As a matter of strategy, India and the ecosystem should be building models that are specialised and solve real problems.
* Guiding Policy 2: We do nothing at the cost of privacy (which is a fundamental right for Indians)
* Guiding Policy 3: We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation for the next&#x20;



*   Guiding Preservation of culture

    * For LLMs to be useful to the population we want - we need to understand them
    * Need examples of how chat gpt messes up for india
    * Indian tokens are expensive
    * Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI
