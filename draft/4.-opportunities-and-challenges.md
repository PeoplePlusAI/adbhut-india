# 4. Diagnosis - Background, Opportunities & Challenges

**Owner**: Pratyush or Mitesh along with an Economics Advisor

**India's Challenges & Opportunities**

* India has the largest digital savvy young population. India also has a unique environment of hundreds of dialects and languages which have led to high barriers of participation for a relatively uneducated individual.
* We have the talent - the people are here, and stuff is being built out of here
  * Get data from elsewhere&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**The I in AI is India article (couldn't find this)**</mark>



**AI & LLMs**

The complexity of life in India leads to many use cases.&#x20;

* multi language
* mixed coding

The Transformer Model and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks do work at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;

While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it. And enable the populace to use it to lower their barriers of participation in the workforce.



**The Result**

This change is powerful and needs to be orchestrated with a concerted effort across Government, companies and educational and research institutions.

Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution do, but for virtually every sector.

**Open Questions :**&#x20;

1. How do we frame a narrative around “how we got here” or what has happened so far. A bird’s eye view of Prof. Mitesh’s article can be useful here, incredibly concise without many technical details.



**Challenges**

1. Data Gap: Limited representation of India's vast diversity.
2. Infrastructure Gap: Not optimised for AI; ROI concerns.
3. Talent Gap (Intellectual Infrastructure):&#x20;
   1. Lack of local AI expertise and opportunities.
   2. Challenges of re-skilling.&#x20;
4. Responsible Futures: Ethics, Policy & Jobs:&#x20;
   1. Need for AI guidelines and transparency
   2. Protection from harm, regulations
5. From Mitesh: Adoption & Deployment challenges: Buy-in from Govt. and sectors belonging here?
6. Big Models (Compute Cost) Gap: Need for sustainable, smaller models.

**Other angles to write this :**&#x20;

1. 5 Layers of Challenges (or Pyramid). Making it an easy-to-understand framework.
2. Layers of Challenges from a “Systems Thinking” approach.
3. Challenge of competing with Large Models and cost of compute.
