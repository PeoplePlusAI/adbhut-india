#### Vision

India can be the use-case capital of the world for AI and have a fully “plus-AI” talent capital for the world (just like it has been a services capital for the world) with a more than 500 million AI-ready workforce.\


#### Why do we need an AI Strategy?

By 2030 (in the next 5-7 years), AI can help unlock efficiencies for India’s workforce, having set in motion a series of events that can help catapult it into a developed country by 2047. This won’t happen by accident. It needs a clear, deliberate, inclusive and comprehensive strategy. If done right, it can be a lever that helps India take its next leap with a new kind of operational efficiency and productivity gains that will not be possible without AI, and will help accelerate India to where it wants to be.&#x20;

This article tries to shape what the elements of that strategy would look like.

Other angles to write this :&#x20;

* India cannot break into a PPP adjusted GDP per Capita of more than $7,000 through normal means of productivity. It needs to push the productivity envelope beyond expectations. And AI can help do that.&#x20;
* AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines.&#x20;
* AI as as accelerant that lets us reach escape velocity to become to developed
* Talk about the Total Factor Productivity or the POV that AI can help unlock those efficiencies?&#x20;

1. <mark style="color:purple;">Should we talk about India in 2047 (at 100 years) and how India’s AI will be a cornerstone in making that a reality? (Read: To escape the middle-income trap, India must push the productivity envelope)</mark>&#x20;
2. <mark style="color:purple;">What will be the economical impact on India with AI? In Jobs (Unemployment and migration) and GDP Growth.</mark>&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:purple;">Should we talk about the Total Factor Productivity or the POV that AI can help unlock those efficiencies?</mark>&#x20;
4. <mark style="color:purple;">What KPIs will be used to evaluate the success of the AI strategy? We should define some quantifiable metrics to track progress.</mark>&#x20;
