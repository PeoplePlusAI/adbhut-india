# 1. Introduction

**Note**: By India here we mean the Government, the companies, people & other research institutions.&#x20;

### Goal of this Strategy (and why do we even need one?)

**In the coming few years, AI will impact more than a billion Indians and the Indian economy (like it will the world) whether we like it or not.** It will be bigger, wider, & faster than any other technology ever before. The defining character of the 21st century for a country will be its ability to leverage AI. Giving birth to multiple other paradigm shifts, the AI Revolution is a mother of all paradigm shifts. India cannot break into a PPP adjusted GDP per Capita of more than $7,000 through normal means of productivity. It needs to push the productivity envelope beyond expectations. And AI can help do that.  **To escape the middle-income trap, India must push the productivity envelope. For India to be a fully developed Nation by 2047, AI will have to be a cornerstone of the strategy.**



**If we let it take its natural course, we will end up in a future by default**&#x20;

Facing unintended consequences of **job** **displacements** without an AI-enabled workforce (of 500 million youth), **models** & applications that are **not sensitive or aligned to Indian culture** and context, **models** and applications that are **not accessible** to a large majority of the country (those with less access to smartphones or ability to speak a "top-22" language, etc.), **data is in silos** which has a large **opportunity cost** in the ability to make governance, administration, distribution, logistics, etc. more efficient.

&#x20;

**To avoid this we need to move to a future by design**.&#x20;

By 2030 (in the next 5-7 years), AI can help unlock efficiencies for India’s workforce, having set in motion a series of events that can help catapult it into a developed country by 2047. **This won’t happen by accident.** It needs a clear, deliberate, inclusive and comprehensive strategy. If done right, it can be a lever that helps India take its next leap with a new kind of operational efficiency and productivity gains that will not be possible without AI, and will help accelerate India to where it wants to be.&#x20;



If used appropriately, AI can be an accelerant that lets us reach escape velocity to become a fully developed nation by 2047. It can be part of the missing link that fills the productivity gaps of our economy. Helping unlock new kinds of efficiencies.





### Targets Success for the Strategy

1. **India by 2030 should have become a fully “plus-AI” talent capital for the world** (just like it has been a services capital for the world) with a more than 500 million AI-ready workforce, leveraging our demographic dividend (not letting it become a demographic burden because of AI-based job displacement).
2. **India by 2030 should have identified use-cases and key sectors to deploy models that manifoldly increase productivity.**
3. **India by 2030 should have in place a comprehensive data sharing framework** for AI Training that allows for privacy guarantees according to Indian laws. This would enable private innovation on top of&#x20;
4. **India by 2030 should have set in motion a complete AI "jugal-bandi" between Samaaj (People), Sarkaar (Government) and Bazaar (the Market)**. Meaning the ecosystem is working together on policy, guardrails as well innovation to help India stay at the frontier.

**This strategy will always be a Work in Progress, also by design.** AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines.&#x20;





**Where we are standing, AI is not a castle in the air.** It is in use and is making a difference on the ground. It is already a part of Aadhaar authentication. Today, because AI is used to monitor tax compliance and leakages in the digital systems of GST and income tax, the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio is at historic highs.

**This gives us the confidence that the next five to 10 years are going to define the future of India.** A future where children are better educated, where people are healthier, where they can use technology in any of India’s 120+ languages, and where everybody can get every imaginable service they want. A future where nobody is left behind.
