# 1. Introduction

**Note**: By India here we mean the Government, the companies, people & other research institutions.&#x20;



### Goal of this Strategy (& why do we even need an AI Strategy?)

* **In the coming few years, AI will impact more than a billion Indians and the Indian economy (like it will the world) whether we like it or not.** It will be bigger, wider, & faster than any other technology ever before. The defining character of the 21st century for a country will be its ability to leverage AI. Giving birth to multiple other paradigm shifts, the AI Revolution is a mother of all paradigm shifts. India cannot break into a PPP adjusted GDP per Capita of more than $7,000 through normal means of productivity. It needs to push the productivity envelope beyond expectations. And AI can help do that.  **To escape the middle-income trap, India must push the productivity envelope. For India to be a fully developed Nation by 2047, AI will have to be a cornerstone of the strategy.**
* **If we let it take its natural course, we will end up in a future by default** with unintended consequences of **job** displacements without an AI-enabled workforce (of 500 million youth), models & applications that are not sensitive or aligned to Indian culture and context, **models** and applications that are not accessibly to a large majority of the country (those with less access to smartphones or ability to speak a "top-22" language, etc.), **data** is silos can have us lose out on productivity gains&#x20;
* **To avoid this we want a future by design**.&#x20;
  * By 2030 (in the next 5-7 years), **AI can help unlock efficiencies** for India’s workforce, having set in motion a series of events that can help catapult it into a developed country by 2047. **This won’t happen by accident.** It needs a clear, deliberate, inclusive and comprehensive strategy. If done right, it can be a lever that helps India take its next leap with a new kind of operational efficiency and productivity gains that will not be possible without AI, and will help accelerate India to where it wants to be.&#x20;
  * If used appropriately, AI can be an accelerant that lets us reach escape velocity to become a fully developed nation. It can be part of the missing link that fills the productivity gaps of our economy. Helping unlock new kinds of efficiencies.
* **This strategy will always be a Work in Progress, also by design.** AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines.&#x20;



### Targets Success for the Strategy

* **India by 2030 should have become a fully “plus-AI” talent capital for the world** (just like it has been a services capital for the world) with a more than 500 million AI-ready workforce, leveraging our demographic dividend (not letting it become a demographic burden because of AI-based job displacement).
* **India by 2030 should have identified use-cases and key sectors to deploy models that manifoldly increase productivity.**
* **India by 2030 should have in place a comprehensive data sharing framework** for AI Training that allows for privacy guarantees according to Indian laws. This would enable&#x20;
