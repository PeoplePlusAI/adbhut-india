# Adbhut AI Strategy

## Introduction

Owner: Harsha (with Tanvi, Tanuj)

#### Vision

India can be the use-case capital of the world for AI and have a fully “plus-AI” talent capital for the world (just like it has been a services capital for the world) with a more than 500 million AI-ready workforce.\


#### Why do we need an AI Strategy?

By 2030 (in the next 5-7 years), AI can help unlock efficiencies for India’s workforce, having set in motion a series of events that can help catapult it into a developed country by 2047. This won’t happen by accident. It needs a clear, deliberate, inclusive and comprehensive strategy. If done right, it can be a lever that helps India take its next leap with a new kind of operational efficiency and productivity gains that will not be possible without AI, and will help accelerate India to where it wants to be.&#x20;

\


This article tries to shape what the elements of that strategy would look like.

\
\
\


Other angles to write this :&#x20;

* India cannot break into a PPP adjusted GDP per Capita of more than $7,000 through normal means of productivity. It needs to push the productivity envelope beyond expectations. And AI can help do that.&#x20;
* AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines.&#x20;
* AI as as accelerant that lets us reach escape velocity to become to developed
* Talk about the Total Factor Productivity or the POV that AI can help unlock those efficiencies?&#x20;

\
\


<mark style="color:purple;">Open Questions :</mark>&#x20;

1. <mark style="color:purple;">Should we talk about India in 2047 (at 100 years) and how India’s AI will be a cornerstone in making that a reality? (Read: To escape the middle-income trap, India must push the productivity envelope)</mark>&#x20;
2. <mark style="color:purple;">What will be the economical impact on India with AI? In Jobs (Unemployment and migration) and GDP Growth.</mark>&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:purple;">Should we talk about the Total Factor Productivity or the POV that AI can help unlock those efficiencies?</mark>&#x20;
4. <mark style="color:purple;">What KPIs will be used to evaluate the success of the AI strategy? We should define some quantifiable metrics to track progress.</mark>&#x20;

## 2. Executive Summary

Owner: Tanvi

(We should definitely have this section either first or second).

\
\


## 3. Background (Optional)

Owner: Harsha & Mitesh

\


Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution do, but for virtually every sector.

\


The Transformer Model and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that neural networks do work at a certain scale. Though the ideas are decades old, only now do we have the kind of data (largely digitised), compute infrastructure (that’s really powerful), and model architectures (such as the Transformer Model) that allow for parallel training of the data.&#x20;

\


While LLMs are the most powerful AI solution we have seen so far, there is more to come and we need to be prepared for it.

\
\


Open Questions :&#x20;

1. How do we frame a narrative around “how we got here” or what has happened so far. A bird’s eye view of Prof. Mitesh’s article can be useful here, incredibly concise without many technical details.

\
\
\


## 4. Opportunity & Challenges

Owner: Pratyush or Mitesh along with an Economics Advisor





Like the Green Revolution brought in a multi-fold increase in agricultural output without a proportional increase in input, so too will the AI Revolution do, but for virtually every sector.

This change is powerful and needs to be orchestrated with a concerted effort across Government, companies and educational and research institutions.

\


1. Data Gap: Limited representation of India's vast diversity.
2. Infrastructure Gap: Not optimised for AI; ROI concerns.
3. Talent Gap (Intellectual Infrastructure):&#x20;
   1. Lack of local AI expertise and opportunities.
   2. Challenges of re-skilling.&#x20;
4. Responsible Futures: Ethics, Policy & Jobs:&#x20;
   1. Need for AI guidelines and transparency
   2. Protection from harm, regulations
5. From Mitesh: Adoption & Deployment challenges: Buy-in from Govt. and sectors belonging here?
6. Big Models (Compute Cost) Gap: Need for sustainable, smaller models.

\
\


Other angles to write this :&#x20;

1. 5 Layers of Challenges (or Pyramid). Making it an easy-to-understand framework.
2. Layers of Challenges from a “Systems Thinking” approach.
3. Challenge of competing with Large Models and cost of compute.

\
\
\


### 5. Guiding Policy

Owner: Tanuj & Harsha



* Guiding Policy 1: We do nothing at the cost of privacy (which is a fundamental right for Indians)
* Guiding Policy 2: We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation for the next&#x20;
* Guiding Policy 3: Solve real problems especially that are unique to India. As a matter of strategy, India and the ecosystem should be building models that are specialised and solve real problems.

\
\


Other angles to write this :&#x20;

1. Can talk in terms of an easy-to-understand framework like the golden triangle of AI

\
\


<mark style="color:purple;">Open Questions :</mark>&#x20;

1. <mark style="color:purple;">How do we gauge and incorporate public opinion on AI ethics and deployment?</mark> &#x20;

\


### 6. Coherent Actions (what are we doing about it/how will we do it?):

\


We need to take coherent actions to enable the ecosystem to thrive and answer “how do we achieve x” by keeping in mind our guiding policy and principles.

\


#### 6.1. Promoting Ecosystem for Building for India’s Unique Use-Cases & for the world

Owner: Tanuj

\


Before we get to doing everything, knowing what use cases can thrive in India/from India will be helpful in focussing limited resources for maximum leverage. Success here will bring in more resources to the problem.

1. How do we do this? / What’s to be done?
   1. Innovation labs
2. High Use in India :&#x20;
   1. Internet penetration is already accelerated. Voice first adoption. We see a lot of voices first, etc. happening in India.&#x20;
3. High Use from India :
   1. We see a use case for +ai talent and with the guiding policy of creating jobs, we need to

\
\


Open Questions :&#x20;

1. How do we encourage AI adoption in sectors where technology is not the core business (like agriculture, healthcare, etc.)?&#x20;

\


#### 6.2. Putting in place a Comprehensive Data & Infrastructure Strategy (Data Do, Compute Lo)

Owner: Pratyush or Mitesh

\


1. Data - How to achieve it (Data do, compute lo):
2.
   1. Data Aggregation: Work with various sectors (healthcare, transportation, agriculture) to compile extensive and diverse datasets. Keeping in mind our guiding policy 1&#x20;

\


2. Infrastructure: Optimise for deployment, ensure ROI, and strategize for future needs.
3. How to achieve it?
4.
   1. AI Hubs: Develop regional AI hubs equipped with state-of-the-art computational resources. This can be done at an institutional level for all educational institutions
   2. Cloud Partnerships: Partner with cloud providers to facilitate computational needs at discounted rates for AI research.

\


Open Questions :&#x20;

1. We should have some form of a data corpus access being built. How do we create frameworks/ partnerships for this?
2. Does the Government invest in Pooled Compute for the ecosystem to thrive?
3. At what price of Compute, does it become feasible to build our own foundational models?
4. Who will be partners? Should we focus on&#x20;

\
\
\


#### 6.3. Smart Model Innovation:&#x20;

Owner: Pratyush or Mitesh

\


1. Push boundaries on efficiency and size. Advocate for sustainable 3B-20B range models. Focus on domain-specific models, distillation, and fine-tuning.&#x20;
2. But how do we do this?
3.
   1. Drive partnerships between research + govt and companies
   2. Focused R\&D: Allocate resources specifically for the development of efficient and domain-specific AI models.&#x20;

\


Open Questions :

1. Who will spear-head this? IIT-like institutes?
2. What will the Govt. + Institutes + Companies partnership look like?

\


#### 6.4. Creating a plus AI Talent Pool that’s able to “Surf” through Job Displacement (Nurture Talent across Institutions that can Implement & Use)

Owner: Someone EkStep team

[https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/adbhut-india/issues/24](https://github.com/PeoplePlusAI/adbhut-india/issues/24)&#x20;

\
\


Launch cutting-edge courses and foster talent, champion AI projects, and establish knowledge hubs.

\


1. Make AI more accessible to use for the public. This includes making models that work for Tier 3 cities and beyond. Eg: Models that work for speakers of other languages such as Hindi, Telugu, etc.

\


2. Jobs & Re-skilling strategy.
3. Re-skilling Platforms: Develop online platforms specifically geared towards re-skilling the existing workforce in AI-related capabilities.&#x20;

\
\


Open Questions :&#x20;

1. What will the re-skilling strategy be?
2. What kind of courses should happen at university level and school level and workforce industry professionals level?
3. How would we approach re-skilling for 500 million adults?  Which industries should we focus on first (1-2 years) and then which in the next 5-7 years? How do we gauge and incorporate public opinion on AI ethics and deployment?&#x20;

\
\


Other angles to write this :&#x20;

1. Write from 3 Levels:&#x20;
2.
   1. Level 1: Talent pool that creates & deploys AI (Researchers etc.)
   2. Level 2: that actively uses AI&#x20;
   3. Level 3: General India - One knows how to use AI.&#x20;
3. Talk in terms of Talent Pool&#x20;

\


#### 6.5. Ensuring Responsible Future (with Ethics, Safety, Guardrails)

Owner: Rahul Matthan

\


* Research AI ethics and safety with Indian Legal Institutes.
* Collaborate with the Government to shape policy for transparent, inclusive AI.&#x20;
* Setup a new regulating agency that optimises for a thriving ecosystem within guardrails (?)

\
\


Open Questions :&#x20;

\


1. Legal Framework: Discuss the legal implications and requirements surrounding AI, such as privacy laws and data sovereignty
2. Ownership & IP Rights: Who owns the data? How do we negotiate the complex terrain of IP rights when data crosses borders?  &#x20;
3. &#x20;What will the regulating body be? Do we need an SRO for regulation in India?

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\


### 7. Meta Section: Incorporating Feedback & Continuous Improvement of Strategy

\


(Not sure what to call this section but this is to address that this strategy isn’t complete and will keep evolving as AI keeps evolving. Eg: If true-AGI emerges in 2 years instead of 10, then we will need to re-think a lot of things here)

\
\


AI innovation is happening in a matter of days, and not weeks, the strategy too needs to be flexible. It should be updated regularly with timelines. Eg: Today, India participating in creating large models and AGI by itself might not make sense computationally and hence is not part of this strategy outline, but as it becomes efficient and if we can contribute in a meaningful way in the future, we should.

\


#### FAQs (Including what we’re not choosing to do & why)

1. **Why are we not building our own LLM? Should the Government or India have its own “India LLM”? Would that even make sense?**

\


2. **Are we doing research on AGI?**
3.
   1. We don’t yet know if just more data and compute with the existing LLM models will lead us to true-AGI. It’s not very likely.
   2. Today, India participating in creating large models and AGI by itself might not make sense computationally and hence is not part of this strategy outline, but as it becomes efficient and if we can contribute in a meaningful way in the future, we should.
   3. Let’s consider if we&#x20;

3. **What are we doing on AI Alignment?**
4.
   1. We

\
\


Open Questions :&#x20;

\


1. Is cost of Compute the main reason to not build Foundational models for India? If so, then at what point of cost of compute does it make sense to explore such models? What are the reasons &#x20;

\


### 8. Conclusion

(Self-explanatory. Should ideally have a call-to-action)
