# 4. Guiding Policy (Our Approach)

### **Guiding Policy 1:** **Always be use-case and people lead (Solving real, unique & diverse problems of Bharat of today)**

Currently very large models are like aeroplanes that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village "kachcha" roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems.&#x20;

* **A Use-case led approach can make us focus our efforts and attention.** Choosing winning use cases for India's problems can result in companies building for India, and attracting foreign capital to India.
* **India should focus on building models that are specialised and solve real problems.** This is not separate from the goal of becoming a world leader in AI or AGI, only that this is our chosen  trajectory to achieve the same end.
* **We want to think in first principles & think of second-order effects** in identifying problems India faces, and then only work backwards from from these cases to what AI can solve. Not every problem might need AI, but we will have recognised the policy and other changes required and share those learnings openly as well. **AI for us should not become a hammer looking for a nail.** Another corollary is that we need to focus on the problems and use-cases to solve, and then evaluate if AI deployment is sensible and feasible in that context.&#x20;
* **Corollary: We need to have in our action plan a feedback loop of generating insights** on Indian problems solvable with AI and share them openly.

### **Guiding Policy 2 - Emphasise the Ecosystem (Create open ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way)**&#x20;

We want to create open ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way.

* &#x20;**India's approach of creating Digital Public Infrastructure,** as a public railroad with private innovation has unlocked enormous productivity. The DPI approach, moved the layer of competition from siloed gardens to broad reach for India. We need to extend it further for AI. Its part of a larger drive to digitise what we're doing, before we can extend it to AI.
* **We have to bring together** the public, private enterprises and research institutions to build systems out of "jugal-bandi" which has uniquely worked very well for India.&#x20;



### **Guiding Policy 3 - Ensure Trust & a Responsible Future.**&#x20;

1. **Guide the Preservation of Indian culture.** Its part of a larger drive to digitise what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI. Guide actions by Bharat culture informed Ethics.&#x20;
2. **Ensure responsible creation, deployment and evaluation of AI systems along with promoting a right policy to regulate while incorporating public opinion on AI ethics & deployment.**  Craft the right policy that is suitable for the unique needs of India.&#x20;
3. **Ensure sustainable absorption of economic shocks and a thriving biosphere for the ecosystem.** Eg: We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation and grow the ecosystem at large, resisting a default power law.
4. **The AI age also necessitates a re-thinking of privacy**. Privacy is a primary consideration while innovating in the digital era (which is a fundamental right for Indians). The concept is likely to undergo radical rethought in the coming years. You want something to be personalised, but you don't want adverse effects. We will need to debate questions such as "can a model use your data or not?" and incorporate them as part of this guiding policy.\
