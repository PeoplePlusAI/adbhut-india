# 4. Guiding Policy (Our Approach)

### **Guiding Policy 1:** **Be Use-Case Lead**

* By anchoring our efforts on solving actual problems, we ensure that the development and deployment of AI technology is meaningful and beneficial to India's populace.&#x20;
* Real-life challenges also present a gold standard test for the applicability and effectiveness of AI, making a use-case led approach a pragmatic strategy.

###

### Guiding Policy 2: Foster Collaboration (Cultivate ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way)

* India's multifaceted nature of problems requires a collective effort from public entities, private enterprises, and research institutions. By promoting collaboration, we can leverage diverse perspectives, resources, and expertise to accelerate the pace of innovation. India's success with Digital Public Infrastructure such as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) has shown that such an approach works remarkably well.
* This would allow us to increase the pace of innovation (by sharing learnings) and reduce duplication of effort (by working parallely on multiple parts of the same problem).



### **Guiding Policy 3 - Think in first principles about the second-order consequences (& deal with them responsibly).**&#x20;

By promoting a culture of thorough deliberation and “thinking through” the potential impacts, we foster a more cautious and informed approach to technological deployment.&#x20;

Eg: We can do Red teaming where independent teams challenge an organisation's plans to identify vulnerabilities and unforeseen consequences before they manifest. This policy not only mitigates risks but also cultivates a culture of accountability and foresight.

**Eg: Ensure sustainable absorption of economic shocks and a thriving biosphere for the ecosystem.** We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation and grow the ecosystem at large, resisting a default power law.&#x20;





### Guiding Policy 4 - Guide the Preservation of India's Culture & Ensure a Responsible Future

\[Related to 3, but worth calling out separately around Responsible Future.]

**We want to ensure responsible creation, deployment and evaluation of AI systems while guiding the preservation of India's culture.** Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI.&#x20;
