### **Guiding Policy 1:** **Always be use-case and people lead (Solving real, unique & diverse problems of Bharat of today)**

* **By adopting a use-case led approach,** we aim to concentrate our efforts on solving India's key problems, potentially attracting foreign capital as companies build solutions for India.&#x20;
* **We strive to identify, evaluate and create AI models that address real issues**, aligning with our goal to become a global AI leader. We'll first pinpoint the core issues, evaluate if AI is a viable solution, and share our findings and necessary policy adjustments openly. Our action plan includes a feedback loop for generating and sharing insights on problems AI can resolve in India.
* **We aim to identify India's core problems first, then assess whether AI can solve them**. Not all issues may need AI, but we'll recognize and openly share the necessary policy adjustments. AI shouldn't just be a solution seeking a problem. Our focus is on addressing the problems at hand, then evaluating the practicality and feasibility of employing AI.

### Guiding Policy 2: Foster an Open Ecosystem (Cultivate ecosystem enablers, the Bharat way)

* India's approach of creating Digital Public Infrastructure, as a public railroad with private innovation has unlocked enormous productivity.&#x20;
* **In order to do this well, we have to bring together** the public, private enterprises and research institutions to build such systems out of "jugal-bandi".&#x20;



### **Guiding Policy 3 - Ensure Trust & a Responsible Future.**&#x20;

1. **Guide Preservation of culture.** Its part of a larger drive to digitize what we're doing, before we can consume it for AI. Guide actions by Bharat culture informed Ethics.&#x20;
2. **Ensure responsible creation, deployment and evaluation of AI systems along with promoting a right policy to regulate while incorporating public opinion on AI ethics & deployment.**  Craft the right policy that is suitable for the unique needs of India.&#x20;
3. **Ensure sustainable absorption of economic shocks and a thriving biosphere for the ecosystem.** Eg: We leverage our youthful population and create flywheel systems for employment generation and grow the ecosystem at large, resisting a default power law.



**Currently very large models are like aeroplane**s that are landing on top of air strips. We need to find a way to take these to every nook and corner of the country - the IT tech corridors, the busy city roads, the village kachcha roads, etc. Here we discuss the need for supporting diverse languages and cultures, quintessentially Indian interests, and a melange of value systems. \
