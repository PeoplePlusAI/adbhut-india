# 5. Key Actions (Main Strategy)

We need to take coherent actions to enable the ecosystem to thrive and answer “how do we achieve x” by keeping in mind our guiding policy and **principles.**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>The Ecosystem Layers relevant for the Strategy</p></figcaption></figure>

## <mark style="color:blue;">6.1. Applications - Identify & Propagate India's Unique use-cases</mark>&#x20;

* Before we get started on building, knowing what use cases can thrive in India/ examples of functioning models from India will be helpful in focussing limited resources for maximum leverage. Success here will bring in more resources to the problem.
* There is a need to then share details on successful use cases widely and openly, to further innovation, replication, or scaling up.

**Some Paradigm Shifts PeoplePlusAI is looking to explore:**

1. **Voice First**
2. **Bottom-up Governance with Conversations at Scale**
3. **+ai talent (more in Section 6.5)**

### **What do we do here?**

1. **Next 3 month:** Conduct deep research to identify problems of Bharat across sectors.
   1. Eg: People's Voice Series as part of PeoplePlusAI.
   2. Identify key sectors and the transformations that will take hold in each one.
   3. Identify how we can best encourage AI adoption in sectors where technology is not the core business (like agriculture, healthcare, etc.)?&#x20;
2. **Next 6 months:**&#x20;
   1. **Pilot hero use-cases.** Establish collaborations with academic institutions and industry bodies to jointly work on pilot projects, deriving insights on AI adoption barriers in non-tech sectors like agriculture and healthcare.
3. **Next 2 years:** \[TBD]



### **To-dos**

1. Break down verticals in each sector.&#x20;
2. List of potential partners that can help carry out the use-case research.



## <mark style="color:blue;">6.2. Models - Encourage Model Innovations with Deep Research</mark>

**Objective** - Aid in creation of AI models that cater to Indian culture, context and languages.

## **What do we do here?**

**Next 3 months focus:**&#x20;

**Benchmark**. Come up with India benchmarks. The benchmark requires accounts for the culture and context of India.



**Next 6 months focus:**&#x20;

Exploring benefits of Indic LLMs trained in Indic languages.



**Next 12 months focus:** &#x20;

1. **Focused R\&D**: Allocate resources specifically for the development of efficient and domain-specific AI models. Focus on building these models, distillation, and fine-tuning. Advocate for sustainable 3B-20B range models.&#x20;
2. **Drive partnerships** between research + govt and companies to create models optimised for India across RLHF.
3. **Building India-focused models (like LLMs) from** scratch with Indic data is a longer-term strategy as it is more expensive. We don't know if a model from scratch will necessarily be any better and justify the cost. It is likely to have the following benefits:
   * Accuracy & fidelity in low-resourced indian languages, specially for in-context long document translation would be significantly better than machine translation models or generic LLMs ([arXiv:2303.12528](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12528))
   * Cost. Language specific models will be cheaper because of the way they are tokenized, bringing the cost point to a level that is manageable for India
   * Safety/Guardrails such as preventing obscene data - which will be business critical - can be assured more on Indic LLMs ([arXiv:2310.02446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02446)). It will also enable more reliable evaluation (eval) for low resource languages.
   * Cultural Nuances about India such as variations in religious beliefs, diets, rituals, values, etc. will be captured in higher fidelity with an Indic LLM.&#x20;

### **Open Questions :**

1. Who will spear-head this? IIT-like institutes?
2. What will the Govt. + Institutes + Companies partnership look like?\


## <mark style="color:blue;">6.3.  Putting in place a Comprehensive Data Unlocking and Sharing Strategy</mark>

**Objective:** Given India's linguistic and cultural diversity, it's essential to collect and curate datasets in multiple Indian languages. This will enable the fine-tuning process to adapt models to understand and interact in various languages, ensuring inclusivity and broader applicability. Unlock data available in Government, companies and people to be used for training while ensuring privacy.

Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.

India has a comparative advantage with the Digital Public Infrastructure based frameworks tending to have a very high adoption and they make sense for the complexity and cross-collaboration of companies to increase efficiency.



### **What do we do from here?**

**Next 3 months focus:**

1. **Evaluate amount of Indic Language data needed (Audit)** such that we can work backwards to have a comprehensive strategy to unlock it. Eg: A goal of 10 billion tokens per language required for improved accuracy on par with English for language and speech models would require a different strategy than if we wanted 100 billion tokens per language.
2. **Evaluate Requirements of a Data Sharing & Reciprocation Strategy (DSRS):** Create platforms that facilitate the exchange of data across sectors, enabling multi-disciplinary collaborations and innovations. Such a platform needs can incorporate a reciprocation strategy for the ecosystem such as **"Data do, Compute Lo"** or "Data do, Model Lo" wherein a company sharing the data for a model to be trained can be given compute or a trained model usage credits in return. while ensuring privacy guarantees along with ecosystem.



**Next 6 months focus:**&#x20;

**Data Corpus Initiatives.** Work with various sectors (healthcare, transportation, agriculture) and the Government to compile extensive and diverse datasets. Keeping in mind our guiding policy that are ethically sourced. **It's crucial to figure out how Government and Private partnerships work with data.**

* **Government Datasets of Indic Languages:** Promote open data initiatives where anonymised and non-sensitive data is made publicly available for research and development purposes.&#x20;
* **Private Datasets:**  Work with various sectors (healthcare, transportation, agriculture) to compile extensive and diverse datasets. Keeping in mind our guiding policy of ensuring a Responsible Future.



**Next 12 months focus:**&#x20;

1. **Create and execute a pilot with the Data Sharing & Reciprocation Strategy (DSRS)** in order to test the use-case.
2. **Elaborate possible Data Copyright & Pricing Policies.** Japan has a copyright-free approach to all data. EU is more stringent. Evaluate what should India's approach be with economic, government, legal and private enterprises views considered. The end-goal would be to have a clear idea on how to price data and how would compensation work for models using a certain kind of data.



## <mark style="color:blue;">6.4. Ensuring Availability of Cost-Effective Compute Infrastructure</mark>

**Objective** - The objective of the Compute Infrastructure is to streamline the deployment of computational resources, ensure a substantial Return on Investment (ROI) through efficient utilization, and strategically plan for the evolving computational needs to foster a conducive environment for innovation and growth in academia, industry, and government sectors.&#x20;

\[Establish need for training and inferencing. Especially the need for specific accelerators which are in short supply. For now we buy, but we need a long term strategy to make compute available with limited dependence. AI is the future of computing, and its needs a lot of compute. Can we think of 1 TFLOP per citizen?]



### **What do we do about Compute?**

**Next 3 months**:&#x20;

**Compute Requirement Assessment:** Conduct a thorough assessment to ascertain the compute requirements of academia and industry.Establish a task force comprising representatives from academia, industry, and government to continuously update these estimates based on emerging needs and technological advancements.



**Next 6 months:**&#x20;

**Cloud Partnerships**: Partner with cloud providers to facilitate computational needs at discounted rates for AI research.



**Next 12 months:**

**Evaluate Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) based compute credit sharing schemes.** Compute Currency



**Open Questions**

1. How to give compute to academia? How to give compute to government use cases?
2. Should the Government invest in Pooled Compute for the ecosystem to thrive?
3. Who will be the right partners?



## <mark style="color:blue;">6.5. Creating a plus AI Talent Pool that’s able to “surf” through Job Displacement (Nurture Talent across Institutions that can Implement & Use)</mark>

* **Imagine if language was no longer barrier for entry for workers.** Once you remove the burden of education or knowing English or another popular language to participate, the only challenge then remains is to skill them in a masterfully crafted learning experience. **Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this.**
* **+ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture.** People who use AI might replace those who don't. These are the "+ai talent". Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this. Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs.



**Launch cutting-edge courses and foster talent, champion AI projects.**

1. **Make AI more accessible to use for the public.** This includes making models that work for Tier 3 cities and beyond. Eg: Models that work for speakers of other languages such as Hindi, Telugu, etc.
2. **Jobs & Re-skilling strategy.**
3. **Re-skilling Platforms:** Develop online platforms specifically geared towards re-skilling the existing workforce in AI-related capabilities.&#x20;





1. **On Agriculture & Allied Workers (200 million+)** - The largest challenge for India to reduce its workforce dependency on agriculture has been a lack of education and training towards industry for these workers. What AI will enable us to do is to exponentially increase access to industry for this workforce by letting them participate in the formal economy and industrial economy by just speaking to an interface in their native dialect and language and learn too from it. It might seem ambitious to cause a migration of work from Agriculture to other sectors but the example of the US shows it can be done. **Agriculture was 50% of us employment in 1900, and by 1970 it was 4% in the US.**&#x20;
2. **Blue Collar Workers & Gig-Workers.**&#x20;
3. **On builders / researchers / engineers** - Need to attract talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.



**Open Questions :**&#x20;

1. **What will the re-skilling strategy be?**
2. What kind of courses should happen at university level and school level and workforce industry professionals level?
3. How would we approach re-skilling for 500 million adults?  Which industries should we focus on first (1-2 years) and then which in the next 5-7 years? How do we gauge and incorporate public opinion on AI ethics and deployment?&#x20;

\


**Other angles to write this :**&#x20;

1. Write from 3 Levels:&#x20;
   1. Level 1: Talent pool that creates & deploys AI (Researchers etc.)
   2. Level 2: that actively uses AI&#x20;
   3. Level 3: General India - One knows how to use AI.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:blue;">6.6. Creating an Ecosystem that Ensures a Responsible Future (with Ethics, Safety, Guardrails)</mark>

* Responsible Future means Responsible AI as well as a sustainable&#x20;
* Research AI ethics and safety with Indian Legal Institutes.
* Setup a new regulating agency that optimises for a thriving ecosystem within guardrails (?)



* **Clear Guidelines:** Draft clear guidelines on data ownership, sharing, and usage to prevent misuse and ensure transparency in data handling.
* **Policy & Regulation.** Engage with legal experts and academia to examine the legal and ethical landscape surrounding AI, crafting preliminary frameworks that prioritize privacy and data sovereignty. Collaborate with the Government to shape policy for transparent, inclusive AI.&#x20;



**To Dos**

* Add long tail scenario of if we have AGI by 2030 what can be done
* Even at a policy and safety net level



**Open Questions :**&#x20;

1. Legal Framework: Discuss the legal implications and requirements surrounding AI, such as privacy laws and data sovereignty
2. Ownership & IP Rights: Who owns the data? How do we negotiate the complex terrain of IP rights when data crosses borders?  &#x20;
3. &#x20;What will the regulating body be? Do we need an SRO for regulation in India?
4. At a policy and safety net level\
