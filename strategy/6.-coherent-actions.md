## 6.1. Applications - Identifying India's unique Use-cases and promoting the industry ecosystem for building for them

Before we get to doing everything, knowing what use cases can thrive in India/from India will be helpful in focussing limited resources for maximum leverage. Success here will bring in more resources to the problem.

Share details on it widely and openly.



**Some Paradigm Shifts PeoplePlusAI is looking exploring:**

1. Voice First
2. Bottom-up Governance because of&#x20;
3. \+ai talent



### **What do we do here?**

1. **Next 3 months:** Conduct deep research to identify problems of Bharat across sectors.
   1. Eg: People's Voice Series as part of PeoplePlusAI.
   2. Identify key sectors and their transformations that will take hold.
   3. Identify how we encourage AI adoption in sectors where technology is not the core business (like agriculture, healthcare, etc.)?&#x20;
2. **Next 6 months:** Pilot hero use-cases. Establish collaborations with academic institutions and industry bodies to jointly work on pilot projects, deriving insights on AI adoption barriers in non-tech sectors like agriculture and healthcare.
3. **Next 2 years:** \[TBD]



### **To-dos**

1. Break down verticals this sectors
2. List of potential partners that can help carry out the use-case research.

## 6.2. Models - Encourage Model Innovations with Deep Research

### **What do we do here?**

1. **Next 3 months focus:**&#x20;
   1. **Benchmark**. Come up with India benchmarks. The benchmark needs accounts for the culture.&#x20;
2. **Next 6 months focus:** Exploring benefits of Indic LLMs trained in Indic languages.
3. **Next 12 months focus:**&#x20;
   1. **Focused R\&D**: Allocate resources specifically for the development of efficient and domain-specific AI models. Focus on domain-specific models, distillation, and fine-tuning. Advocate for sustainable 3B-20B range models.&#x20;
   2. **Drive partnerships** between research + govt and companies to create models optimised for India across RLHF.
   3. **Building India-focused LLMs from** scratch with indic data is a longer-term strategy as it is more expensive. We should first see if adaptation of another LLAMA-like model does the job for us. We don't know if a model from scratch will necessarily be any better. Regardless the benchmark and data layers need to be in place.\


### **Open Questions :**

1. Will this primarily be an RAG play?
2. Who will spear-head this? IIT-like institutes?
3. What will the Govt. + Institutes + Companies partnership look like?\




## 6.3.  Putting in place a Comprehensive Data & Compute Infrastructure Strategy (Data Do, X Lo)

### **6.3.1. Data**&#x20;

Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.

India has a comparative advantage with the Digital Public Infrastructure based frameworks tending to have a&#x20;



**Objective:** Unlock data available in Government, companies and people to be used for training while ensuring privacy.



**What do we need?**

* Given India's linguistic diversity, it's essential to collect and curate datasets in multiple Indian languages. This will enable the fine-tuning process to adapt models to understand and interact in various languages, ensuring inclusivity and broader applicability.



**How to achieve it (Timelines)**

1. **Data do, compute lo:**
2. **Data Aggregation**: Work with various sectors (healthcare, transportation, agriculture) to compile extensive and diverse datasets. Keeping in mind our guiding policy.
3. DEPA 3.0



### **What do we do from here?**

1. **Open Data Initiatives**:&#x20;
   1. **Government Datasets:** Promote open data initiatives where anonymized and non-sensitive data is made publicly available for research and development purposes.&#x20;
   2. **Private Datasets:**  Work with various sectors (healthcare, transportation, agriculture) to compile extensive and diverse datasets. Keeping in mind our guiding policy of ensuring a Responsible Future.
2. **Define Requirements of Data Exchange Platforms:** Create platforms that facilitate the exchange of data across sectors, enabling multi-disciplinary collaborations and innovations. Such a platform needs can incorporate a reciprocation strategy for the ecosystem such as "Data do, Compute Lo" wherein a company sharing the data for a model to be trained can be given compute or a trained model usage credits in return.
3. **Evaluate need for Standardised Data Sharing Formats**: Promote the use of standardised data sharing formats to ensure data interoperability across different sectors and platforms while ensuring privacy guarantees along with ecosystem&#x20;
4. **Next 6 months focus:**&#x20;
5. **Next 12 months focus:** Create a framework for sharing &#x20;



**List of Government Data Sources &**&#x20;

1. National Book Trust&#x20;
2. Doordarshan&#x20;
3. India Meteorological Department&#x20;
4. Survey of India
5. National Statistical Office
6. National Accounts Statistics of India



**Open Questions :**

1. How to price Data? Japan has a copyright-free approach to all data. EU is more stringent. What should our approach be?
2. We should have some form of a data corpus access being built. How do we create frameworks/ partnerships for this?
3. How to have Government / Private partnerships work with data?



### &#x20;**6.3.2. Compute Infrastructure**:&#x20;

**Objective** - Optimise for deployment, ensure ROI, and strategise for future needs.

#### **What do we do about Compute?**

1. **Next 3 months**:&#x20;
   1. Get clear estimates of compute requirements for academia and industry and add them here and continuously update those numbers.
2. **Next 6 months:**&#x20;
   1. **Cloud Partnerships**: Partner with cloud providers to facilitate computational needs at discounted rates for AI research.
3. **Next 12 months:**
   1. **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) based compute credit sharing schemes.** Compute Currency



**Open Questions**

1. How to give compute to academia? How to give compute to government use cases?
2. Should the Government invest in Pooled Compute for the ecosystem to thrive?
3. Who will be the right partners?



## 6.4. Creating a plus AI Talent Pool that’s able to “surf” through Job Displacement (Nurture Talent across Institutions that can Implement & Use)

* **Imagine if language was no longer barrier for entry for workers.** Once you remove the burden of education or knowing English or another popular language to participate, the only challenge then remains is to skill them in a masterfully crafted learning experience
* **+ai talent is a new kind of talent that we must nurture.** People who use AI might replace those who don't. These are the "+ai talent". Jobs and job boundaries are going to be blurred, we can take advantage of this
* Skilling people up to a level of proficiency will be simpler, we need to close the loop on skilling, certification and jobs



**Launch cutting-edge courses and foster talent, champion AI projects.**

1. **Make AI more accessible to use for the public.** This includes making models that work for Tier 3 cities and beyond. Eg: Models that work for speakers of other languages such as Hindi, Telugu, etc.
2. **Jobs & Re-skilling strategy.**
3. **Re-skilling Platforms:** Develop online platforms specifically geared towards re-skilling the existing workforce in AI-related capabilities.&#x20;



**There are different segments of "talent" and each requires a different granularity of thinking -**&#x20;

1. **On Agriculture & Allied Workers (200 million +)** - The largest challenge for India to reduce its workforce dependency on agriculture has been a lack of education and training towards industry for these workers. What AI will enable us to do is to exponentially increase access to industry for this workforce by letting them participate in the formal economy and industrial economy by just speaking to an interface in their native dialect and language and learn too from it.
2. **Blue Collar Workers.**&#x20;
3. **Gig-Workers.**&#x20;
4. **On builders / researchers / engineers** - Need to attract talent, in a globally competitive race. Need to provide access to compute and capital, and high incentives to innovate. Need to appreciate geopolitical implications and strategic applications which need to be domiciled in the country. Should make available data ecosystems which create funnels of data by domain across unstructured text, structured textbooks, knowledge bases, preference data, etc.



**Open Questions :**&#x20;

1. What will the re-skilling strategy be?
2. What kind of courses should happen at university level and school level and workforce industry professionals level?
3. How would we approach re-skilling for 500 million adults?  Which industries should we focus on first (1-2 years) and then which in the next 5-7 years? How do we gauge and incorporate public opinion on AI ethics and deployment?&#x20;

\


**Other angles to write this :**&#x20;

1. Write from 3 Levels:&#x20;
   1. Level 1: Talent pool that creates & deploys AI (Researchers etc.)
   2. Level 2: that actively uses AI&#x20;
   3. Level 3: General India - One knows how to use AI.&#x20;

## 6.5. Creating an Ecosystem Ensuring a Responsible Future (with Ethics, Safety, Guardrails)

* Responsible Future means Responsible AI as well as a sustainable&#x20;
* Research AI ethics and safety with Indian Legal Institutes.
* Setup a new regulating agency that optimises for a thriving ecosystem within guardrails (?)



* **Clear Guidelines:** Draft clear guidelines on data ownership, sharing, and usage to prevent misuse and ensure transparency in data handling.
* **Policy & Regulation.** Engage with legal experts and academia to examine the legal and ethical landscape surrounding AI, crafting preliminary frameworks that prioritize privacy and data sovereignty. Collaborate with the Government to shape policy for transparent, inclusive AI.&#x20;



**To Dos**

* Add long tail scenario of if we have AGI by 2030 what can be done
* Even at a policy and safety net level



**Open Questions :**&#x20;

1. Legal Framework: Discuss the legal implications and requirements surrounding AI, such as privacy laws and data sovereignty
2. Ownership & IP Rights: Who owns the data? How do we negotiate the complex terrain of IP rights when data crosses borders?  &#x20;
3. &#x20;What will the regulating body be? Do we need an SRO for regulation in India?
4. **At a policy and safety net level**\
